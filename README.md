# Query-A-Digital-Music-Store-Database
**Project Requirements**

Your presentation should include:

-Four slides

-One visualization per slide

-A 1-2 sentence explanation of each slide

-The SQL query is used to create the data used in the visualization.

**Note:** you may choose to use queries motivated by the questions on the previous concepts or choose four entirely new questions. However, if you use any of the previous queries, they must have a JOIN as stated in the Rubric.

We have provided a Submission Template that you may use or you may create your own presentation from scratch. The template is a PowerPoint file that can also be used in Google Slides and other popular presentation software programs.

In order to review your presentation, you will need to save your slides as a PDF. ** **You can do this from within a presentation tool by selecting File > Download as > PDF Document.

**Queries**
Please include a text file that includes each of the queries used to create the visualizations.

All SQL queries run without errors and produce the intended results.
-Each SQL query needs to include one or more explicit join(s). The query's JOIN or JOINs should be necessary to answer the question. If a question does not require a JOIN, please change the question to be one that does.

-Each SQL query needs to include one or more aggregation(s). This could be a COUNT, AVG, SUM, or other aggregation.

-The project includes at least four unique SQL queries.


Please format your queries for readability, use a SQL formatting tool like:

-sqlformat.org

-sql-format.com

Then paste your code into a plain text file .txt.


You can use:

-Notepad on a Mac

-Notepad++ - an open source code editor for Windows

-Atom - an open source code editor for Windows, Linux or macOS systems

-or any other plain text editor

**Example Queries in Plain Text**
/* Query 1 - query used for first insight /
`SELECT t1.col, COUNT(ct)
FROM table1 t1
JOIN table2 t2
ON t1.col = t2.col
GROUP BY t1.col;`

/* Query 2 - query used for second insight /
`SELECT t1.col, COUNT(ct)
FROM table1 t1
JOIN table2 t2
ON t1.col = t2.col
GROUP BY t1.col;`

**Visualizations**

We suggest using a spreadsheet application, such as Excel or Google Sheets, to create your visualizations. However, you’re welcome to use whatever tool you’d like. Your visualizations could be any that you learned about in the previous lesson. Below is one example, and a link has been provided to an example slide.

Example of a horizontal bar chart showing the total spent by each country in U.S. dollars with an explanation of what the visualization is showing. 
You should have four slides similar to the example above, but the questions you ask are up to you, and all four of your final submitted queries should contain a JOIN and AGGREGATION. Look at the Rubric to verify you have met all of the necessities for this submission.

**Submitting Your Project**

Once you have completed the presentation and created the text file, put your text file and presentation in a folder and zip it and submit the zipped folder for your project.

In order to review your presentation, you will need to save your slides as a PDF. You can do this from within a presentation tool by selecting File > Download as > PDF Document.

**Additional Guidelines**

There shouldn’t be any additional data prep (sorting, filtering, renaming, etc.) between the query output and the visualization.

All your four queries must include at least one join and aggregation.

Review your project against the Project Rubric. Reviewers will use this to evaluate your work.

The first part of this project is aimed at helping you understand the database, so you can ask interesting questions in the second part. Feel free to use and expand upon the queries you wrote in the first part.

Once you've finished your project, submit the presentation as a PDF and the queries as a .txt file.

Don't be afraid to challenge yourself! Try to combine the SQL concepts you know!
